
JasperReports Library 6.4.3 Change Log
=============================================

- removed JExcelApi dependency and the deprecated source code using it, 
including exporters, data sources and query executers;

- removed deprecated HTML and XHTML exporters;

- support for simple text expressions to simplify writing expressions for custom properties, 
which rely on direct parameter/field/variable reference in-place value expansion, 
instead of the usual Java language string concatenation syntax;

- introducing support for custom properties annotations for better documentation 
of all available JasperReports configurations and for enhanced custom properties 
helper tools in Jaspersoft Studio;

- added new isPreventOrphanFooter flag added to report and dataset group definitions, 
to avoid rendering group footers without any accompanying record at the top of new pages;

- added new minDetailsToStartFromTop attribute in report and dataset group definitions, 
to avoid rendering group headers too low on the page, where not enough detail records can fit;

- refactored some of the provided samples, including the Web application samples, 
to make use of the Jetty engine and make it easier to test them locally;

- minor bug fixes and improvements;
